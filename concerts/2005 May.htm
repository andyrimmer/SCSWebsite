            <p> To celebrate the centenary of Sir. Michael Tippet's birth in 1905, the choir interspersed his famous settings of negro spirituals from "A Child Of Our Time" with Father Guido Haazan's "Missa Luba", based on African melodies and rhythms and accompanied by drumming. The Sanctus features in the 1968 film "If". Mozart's "Requiem" was also performed. Mozart died before completing the work at the age of 35 and the mystery surrounding the piece is dramatised in the film "Amadeus". </p>

            <h2>Tippett: <em>Five Negro Spirituals </em></h2>
            <p>Tippett's oratorio <em>A Child of Our Time</em> was inspired by the assassination in Paris in 1938 of a German diplomat by a young Polish Jew (leading to the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938), and was first performed in 1944. Tippett used the <em>Five Negro Spirituals</em> in the oratorio as Bach used the chorales in his settings of the <em>Passions</em>, and his publishers persuaded him to arrange them for unaccompanied chorus. He did so in 1958 with some reluctance, but later wrote that in this setting 'they became, as it were, the huge voice of a crowd of folk singing together.' He heard this for himself at a performance in Georgia, the home of the Negro spiritual in the Deep South, when the whole audience joined in together in singing them.</p>
            <h5>Missa Luba</h5>
            <p>The <em>Missa Luba</em> is a Congolese folk mass. With its strict rhythmic tom-tom beat and the simple repeated melody lines of African traditional music, it is not a formal musical composition, but in the words of Fr Guido Haazen who arranged the music, 'the product of a collective improvisation' by himself and the Congolese choir with whom he worked. The mass was originally recorded by tenor solo and choir of men and boys, and published in written notation in 1964. Tonight we are singing only three movements of the full mass, the <em>Sanctus, Benedictus</em> and <em>Agnus Dei</em>.</p>
            <h2 align="center"><strong>Copland, Vaughan Williams: <em>Folk Songs</em></strong></h2>
            <p>Copland and Vaughan Williams were, arguably, the two composers of the 20 th century who were most influenced by the traditions of folk music. </p>
            <p>As a young man Copland studied in Paris, but his compelling interest was to develop a distinctively American style of music, and his success in doing so comes through clearly in three popular ballet scores, <em>Billy the Kid, Rodeo</em> and <em>Appalachian Spring</em>. His setting of <em>The Boatmen's Dance</em> is of a song first dated to 1843.<strong></strong></p>
            <p> The influence of folk song on Vaughan Williams was more direct. During his thirties he spent 10 years building up a collection of over 800 songs and their variants from Norfolk, Surrey, Sussex, Herefordshire and other counties, establishing him as the leader of the English folksong movement. The last verse of <em>Linden Lea</em> expresses something more forceful than the simple rural idyll.<strong></strong></p>

            <h2><strong>Mozart: <em>Requiem Mass </em></strong></h2>
            <p>Mozart was working on the <em>Requiem Mass</em> when he died in Vienna on 5 December 1791 at the age of 34, leaving it unfinished. The original commission appears to have been anonymous in a letter signed by 'a devotee of your art'. For these two reasons, since the time of Mozart's death there has been debate, at times heated, on the detailed authenticity and the artistic merit of parts of the work (for example, the brief and somewhat thin writing of the <em>Osanna</em> and its weak repetition).</p>
            <p> Nevertheless, it is now accepted that the <em>Requiem</em> was commissioned by Count Franz Walsegg-Stuppach in memory of his wife who died in February 1791, and that it was Mozart's widow, Constanze, who ensured its completion by asking Mozart's pupils and friends, in particular Franz S&uuml;ssmayer, to undertake the task. (S&uuml;ssmayer says in a letter of September 1800 that, before he was approached, several composers were asked to finish the work.) The first movement, finished by Mozart, was performed at his memorial service on 10 December 1791. S&uuml;ssmayer finished his completion by the end of spring 1792, and the first performance of the full work with S&uuml;ssmayer's completion was given in January 1793 at a benefit concert for Constanze and her children.</p>
            <p> The original scores of the <em>Requiem</em> are in two volumes in the keeping of the Austrian National Library. The first volume contains the complete score as presented to Count Walsegg by Constanze, with the autograph manuscript of the <em>Introit</em> and much of the <em>Kyrie</em> in Mozart's own hand and the rest of the work in S&uuml;ssmayer's hand. The second volume contains the draft in Mozart's hand of the vocal parts and figuring of the instrumental bass for all the movements of the <em>Sequenz</em> and the <em>Offertorium</em>. In a letter of February 1800 to the Leipzig publishers of the first edition S&uuml;ssmayer says that the <em>Lacrimosa</em> from bar 9 (the first eight bars having been written by Mozart), the <em>Sanctus</em>, <em>Benedictus</em> and <em>Agnus Dei</em> were his work. In a letter of March 1799 Constanze says that repetition of the material of the opening <em>Introit</em> and <em>Kyrie</em> for the closing <em>Lux Aeterna</em> was suggested by Mozart just before he died, and in another letter of March 1827 she says that S&uuml;ssmayer had use of material sketched out by Mozart for the missing movements.</p>

      <tr bgcolor=ivory>
        <td><p>The Requiem in D-minor, unfinished at the time of Mozart&rsquo;s death (1791) and completed, in part from Mozart&rsquo;s drafts, by Sussmayer, used the full Catholic liturgy for a Requiem Mass for the dead. The words of the opening movement (<em>Requiem aeternam</em>) are loosely based on Psalm 65 v.1-2 and on an Apocryphal passage from Esdras (ch.2 v. 34-35). The 47-line poem of the <em>Dies irae</em> (sections 2-7 below) was incorporated into the Mass in the 14 th-century, and is often attributed to the Franciscan Thomas of Celano; it has various Biblical sources, but is in part a meditation on Luke 21, v. 25-36. The Offertorium (<em>Domine Jesu </em>and <em>Hostias, </em>sections 8 and 9 below) originated as prayers recited for the sick and dying. The final movements (<em>Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei, </em>sections 10-12) accompany the consecration in all standard settings of the Mass.</p>
