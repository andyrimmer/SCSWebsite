        <td><h2>Programme Notes</h2>
          <p class="subtext">Faur&eacute; (1845-1924), Vierne (1870-1937) and Durufl&eacute; (1902-1986) are among the most prominent in a line of 19th and 20th French composers and organists which began with C&eacute;sar Franck (1822-1890). All three of them passed through the Paris Conservatoire, as pupil and teacher or professor (Vierne and Durufl&eacute;), or as teacher and director (Faur&eacute;). Durufl&eacute; was deputy to Vierne as organist at the cathedral of N&ocirc;tre Dame.</p>
          <p class="subtext"> Gabriel Faur&eacute;, born in 1845, began his musical schooling in 1854 at the &Eacute;cole Niedermeyer in Paris. On leaving here in 1865 he took up a succession of posts as organist. He joined the staff of the Paris Conservatoire as teacher of composition (one of his pupils was Ravel) and in 1905 was appointed its director, a post he held until 1920. The last years of his life until his death in 1924 were marked by growing deafness and failing health.<br>
  During his early years in Paris Faur&eacute; was little recognised in musical circles, but from the 1890s his growing reputation as organist and composer came to be publicly recognised, and he was acclaimed in the grand salons of Paris and other cities in Europe, including London. His chamber music covered a wide range of works for piano and strings, and his three collections of songs, published in 1879, 1897 and 1908, have led to him being described as 'the greatest master of French song'. His other writing included sacred music and small-scale operatic and orchestral works, but it is the Requiem which, little noticed when first performed in Paris in 1888, is his best-loved work in the popular repertoire.</p>
          <p class="subtext"> Louis Vierne, born in 1870, suffered from bad eye-sight, poor health, and financial problems for most of his life. In early 1890 he entered the Paris Conservatoire to study the organ under C&eacute;sar Franck, and in 1894 won first prize in a competition and was taken onto the teaching staff. In 1900 he was appointed organist at Notre Dame, a post which he held with distinction and renown until his death in 1937. But in spite of wide-spread recognition of his outstanding technique as an organist, he was twice passed over for appointment as professor of organ at the Conservatoire.<br>
  Between 1898 and 1930 Vierne wrote six symphonies for organ which are regarded as the pinnacle of 20th century organ music, high in the organist's repertoire. He was also a master of smaller musical forms: piano sonatas, works for solo organ including a group of 24 songs without words, and more than 60 songs for the voice, but only a few choral works of which the Messe Solennelle is the most important.</p>
          <p class="subtext"> Maurice Durufl&eacute;, born in 1902, received his early musical training in the tradition of choral plainsong at the Rouen choir school. In 1920 he went on to the Paris Conservatoire, where he won five first prizes (in organ, harmony, accompaniment, fugue and composition), and where one of his teachers was Vierne. From 1927 he was Vierne's deputy as organist at N&ocirc;tre Dame, and in 1930 he moved to St Etienne-du-Mont, another Paris church, where he stayed as organist until his death in 1986. He toured widely in Europe and America, and from 1943 to 1970 he was professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire.<br>
  Though not a prolific composer, Durufle's was a distinctive voice in the French 20th century repertoire as an exponent of plainsong and, following Vierne and others, in the use of modal harmonies and polyphonic structures. His first published work came out in 1924, and his Requiem, written in 1947, like Vierne's stands alongside Faur&eacute;'s in musical importance if not in concert popularity.</p>
          <p class="subtext"><strong>Vierne: Messe Solennelle</strong><br>
  Vierne wrote the Messe Solennelle in 1900, the year in which Faur&eacute; published the full orchestral score of his Requiem. It is scored for chorus and organ and has five movements, omitting the Credo:<br>
  <em>Kyrie Sanctus Agnus Dei<br>
  Gloria Benedictus</em><br>
  It is a work of considerable power. Solennelle is a fitting title and Vierne's musical directions are maestoso and risoluto. He makes extensive use of the semitones of the 12 note chromatic scale, producing dissonances and modulations into related keys which now seem deceptively easy to the ear, but in 1900 must have been remarkable if not outrageous. This is especially marked in the Kyrie and Gloria, in which great blocks of sound, particularly suited to the organ, contrast with quiet melodic phrases sung by one part on its own. The last two movements are more reflective, though the resounding Hosannas of the Sanctus are repeated in the Benedictus, and the work ends with the closing bars of the Agnus Dei moving confidently into the major key.</p>
          <p class="subtext"><strong>Faur&eacute;: Cantique de Jean Racine</strong><br>
  Shortly before he left &Eacute;cole Niedermeyer in 1865 Faur&eacute; won first prize in the school competition for musical composition with this piece, a setting of a hymn translated by the French poet and dramatist Jean Racine (1639-1699) from the Latin of the Roman Breviary (the daily order of service). It is a simple meditative piece offering a foretaste of the calm and peace of the Requiem on which he started work 12 years later. </p>
          <p class="subtext"><strong>Durufl&eacute;: Tota Pulchra Es</strong><br>
  In 1960 Durufl&eacute; published four short motets based on plainsong Gregorian chant. Three of these are written for full four-part mixed choir and the fourth, Tota Pulchra Es, for three-part choir of women's voices only. Each part follows its own plainsong line with no hint of a fugal structure, and all three lines are woven together into one harmonious whole. </p>
          <p class="subtext"><strong>Faur&eacute;: Requiem</strong><br>
              <em>Introit and Kyrie Pie Jesu In Paradisum<br>
  Offertorium Agnus Dei<br>
  Sanctus Libera me</em><br>
  Faur&eacute; started work on the Requiem in 1877, not specifically for any person or occasion, but 'for the pleasure of it'. Its first performance was not given until 1888, and this first version, scored for organ and small chamber orchestra, had only five movements. Two more movements, the Offertorium and the Libera me, were added for a performance in 1893, and it was not until 1900 that Faur&eacute; completed the full orchestral version for the first concert performance. The original organ part provides a full accompaniment, to which the score for chamber orchestra provides no additional material, and tonight we use no orchestra. The Pie Jesu is sung solo by the soprano and the baritone joins the chorus in the Offertorium and Libera me.<br>
  This Requiem is a reflective and gentle work, making no reference to the stern and judgemental aspects of the conventional Requiem Mass, apart from a few bars in the Libera me which have the text of the Dies irae but are hardly dark and foreboding. It conveys Faur&eacute;'s view of death as 'a joyful deliverance, an aspiration towards happiness beyond the grave', fully expressed in the calmness of the In Paradisum.</p>
          <p class="subtext"><strong>Durufl&eacute;: N&ocirc;tre P&egrave;re</strong><br>
  After the peaceful close to the Requiem, the evening's programme comes quietly to an end with a simple setting by Durufl&eacute; of the Lord's Prayer, sung in French.</p>

          <span><a name="cantique"></a>GABRIEL FAUR&Eacute; &ndash; CANTIQUE DE JEAN RACINE - choir</span></p>
          <p>In 1866, at the age of twenty, Faur&eacute; composed this setting of a canticle, for the occasion of the blessing of the organ at the Church of Saint-Sauveur in Rennes (where he was then organist). The words were a translation from a Latin original into French by the great poet and playwright Jean Racine, who had published them in 1687 as part of his version of the Latin Breviary. Interestingly, Faur&eacute; set only the first three of the four verses of Racine&rsquo;s lyrical rendering of this canticle for Tuesday Matins. </p>
