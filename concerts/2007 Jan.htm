        <p class="text style1">From the Oxford Times review (Nicola Lisle, 2 February 2007):</p>
        <p>&quot;An exceptionally well-drilled choir, their crisp entries were faultless, their intonation spot on, and their enthusiasm couldn't be doubted for a moment.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;The orchestra played with energy and brilliance throughout.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;There was some thrilling work from the four soloists, whose voices blended exceptionally well - despite the fact that bass Simon Whiteley had stepped in at short notice to replace an indisposed Tom Edwards.&quot; </p>

    <td bgcolor="#FFFFF0"><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Both the  <em>Masses</em> were commissioned  by Haydn's patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterh&aacute;zy&nbsp;II, to celebrate the name-day  of his wife, Princess Maria Hermenegild.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The <strong><em>'Maria Theresa' Mass</em></strong> was the  earlier work, first performed on 8th September 1799 and the fourth  of the six masses written by Haydn during the years 1796-1802 to celebrate the  Princess' name-day.&nbsp; It appears to have  acquired its nickname (<em>Theresienmesse</em> in the German) after a performance  a few years later at the court chapel in Vienna of Francis I, Emperor of  Austria, in which his wife the Empress Maria Theresa was the soprano soloist.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The <strong><em>Mass in  C</em></strong> was first performed on 13th September 1807 and was written  during Beethoven's middle period of prodigious musical activity.&nbsp; Haydn, the most distinguished living  composer, died in 1809, and the depth and fullness of his last six masses must  have invited critical comparison with the <em>Mass in C</em>.&nbsp; Beethoven himself regarded it highly, but it  was not well received by the Count and the musical circles of Vienna, a  reaction which is perhaps not surprising in the light of the early reviews of,  for example, Beethoven's 1st and 2nd Symphonies, first  performed in 1800 and 1803, which were variously described as 'inventive',  'difficult', 'completely extraordinary', 'richly furnished with detail'.</p>
      <p>       The  liturgical text of the Mass imposes itself on the structure and style of the  music in two ways.&nbsp; The six main elements  of the liturgy require a structure of six separate movements for the work as a  whole; at the same time the contrasting moods of different sections of the  text, particularly in the<em> Gloria</em> and the <em>Credo</em>, demand to be  reflected in contrasts of musical colour and mood.&nbsp; The musical contrasts can be so sharp that  the sections stand separate from each other within the movement, or they can be  marked by gentle modulations from major to minor key and changes in tempo with  only a pause in the flow of the music.</p>
      <p>       The  two <em>Masses</em> show this difference of approach.&nbsp; In the <em>'Maria Theresa' Mass</em> the longer  movements have clearly contrasting separate sections, conforming to the sections  of the text as set out in the synopsis.&nbsp;  In the <em>Mass in C</em>, whose synopsis shows the same divisions in the  text save for one difference in the <em>Gloria</em>, these movements have similar  contrasts of musical mood and colour, but the flow of the music is uninterrupted.&nbsp; Both composers use the soloists to mark the  start of a new section, both <em>Masses</em> have fugues at the end of the <em>Credo</em>,  and both have strikingly lyrical movements, the <em>Gratias</em> in the <em>'Maria  Theresa' Mass</em>, the<em> Benedictus</em> in the <em>Mass in C</em>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Performing the  two <em>Masses</em> alongside each other offers the opportunity to judge how  close was any affinity between the work of Haydn and Beethoven.&nbsp; The Viennese audience of 1807 may have been  more loyal to the familiar and more comfortable music of Haydn.&nbsp; We, who know the <em>Missa Solemnis</em> of  1824, may feel that with the <em>Mass in C</em> Beethoven was closer to Haydn  than he was to his own tormented self in his later work.</p>
