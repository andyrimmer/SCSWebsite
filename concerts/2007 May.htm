    <td bgcolor="#FFFFF0"><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Our programme this evening covers three  centuries of church music from the late 17th to the late 20th  centuries, drawing on earlier traditions of polyphonic choral writing and the  sacred music of the Orthodox church.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the first part, works by Stravinsky and  Tavener evoke the Orthodox tradition, in the appropriate setting of a mid-Victorian church  echoing the apse and decorative murals of a Byzantine basilica.&nbsp; In the second part of the programme the main  work by the Victorian English composer Pearsall looks back to renaissance polyphony.&nbsp; Short  works by Mozart, Pearsall and the Italian 17th/18th  century composer Pitoni open and close the programme.</p>
      <h3>Mozart:&nbsp; Ave verum  corpus, Laudate Dominum</h3>
        <p><strong>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong> (1756-1791) is not considered primarily as a composer of sacred  music, but these two pieces, both sacred, are among his best known minor works,  and both reveal a reverence which is perhaps unexpected in Mozart.</p>
        <p><br>
        The motet <em>Ave  verum corpus</em> was written in June 1791, six months before his death in Vienna, at the request of Anton Stoll, choirmaster of the  church at Baden.&nbsp; The text, dating from the 14th  century, occurs at a central point in the Catholic Mass, and has been set to  music by several composers.</p>
        <p><br>
        Psalm  117 <em>Laudate Dominum</em> is one of six psalms used in the evening service of <em>Vesperae  solennes de confessore</em>.&nbsp; Mozart wrote  this setting, for soprano solo and chorus, in 1780 during one of the  intermittent periods of paid employment of his somewhat turbulent life, when he  was organist at the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg from 1779 to 1781.</p>
        <h3>Stravinsky:&nbsp; Mass,  Pater Noster</h3>
        <p><strong>Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky</strong> was born near St Petersburg in 1882  and died in New York  in 1971.&nbsp; Though he took a law degree at St Petersburg in 1907,  his enthusiasm was for music and in 1902 he had begun studying musical  composition under Rimsky-Korsakov.&nbsp; In  1910, following a visit to Paris for the first  performance of his ballet <em>The Firebird</em>, he moved to Switzerland.&nbsp; The First World War and the Russian  Revolution precluded his return to Russia,  and in 1920 he moved to France  taking citizenship in 1934.&nbsp; At the start  of the Second World War he was in the United States, and there he  remained taking citizenship in 1945 and making it his home for the rest of his  life.<br>
  </p>
        <p> Stravinsky's  work covers the whole range of musical form: opera and ballet, orchestral and  instrumental works, songs and chamber music, and choral and religious  works.&nbsp; His musical style, as  characterised by the scholars, developed from his Russian period, up to the  early 1920s when he moved to France,  to the Neo-Classical period, and finally in the early 1950s to his Serial  period, which built on Schoenberg's twelve-note chromatic system.&nbsp; Pervading characteristics of his writing are  dissonance and irregular rhythm, and these feature strongly in his <em>Mass</em>.<br>
  </p>
        <p> Stravinsky  was a deeply religious man, brought up in the Russian Orthodox Church, but  strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic faith of his father.&nbsp; His <em>Mass</em>, written during the years 1944 to 1948  and first performed in Milan in 1948 and then in  New York in  1949, was (in his own words) &quot;partly provoked by some Masses of Mozart  &hellip;..&nbsp; As I played through these rococo-operatic  sweets-of-sin, I knew I had to write a Mass of my own, but a real one&quot;, and &quot;I  wanted my Mass to be used liturgically, an outright impossibility as far as the  Russian Church was concerned, as Orthodox tradition proscribes musical  instruments in its services&quot;.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The <em>Mass</em> is scored for  chorus and double wind quintet, with short passages for soloists in the <em>Gloria</em> and the <em>Sanctus</em>.&nbsp; Stravinsky notes  that &quot;children's voices should be employed&quot; for the treble/soprano  and alto parts, but in concert performances these are generally given to adult  singers.&nbsp; Each movement stands on its own  allowing it to fit easily into the structure of the church service, and the  text runs through without elaboration.&nbsp;  There is little thematic material in the music.&nbsp; The colourful solo passages in the <em>Gloria</em> and the <em>Sanctus</em> contrast withthe choral sections of the <em>Gloria</em> and the firm statements of the <em>Credo</em>, which echo the recitation of Orthodox liturgical chant in a succession  of marching chords (Stravinsky's words again: &quot;one composes a march to  facilitate marching men, so with my <em>Credo</em> I hope to provide an aid to  the text. &hellip;. There is much to believe.&quot;).<br>
          </p>
        <p>Between the <em>Gloria</em> and the<em> Credo</em> the soloists will sing Stravinsky's setting of the <em>Pater  Noster</em> (the <em>Lord's Prayer</em>), written in 1926, which again reflects  the chanting of Orthodox liturgy.</p>
