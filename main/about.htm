                            <p align="justify"><img src="../images/MMM-2013-Crop.jpg" alt="Performing in St Barnabas, Jericho" width="375" height="250" hspace="10" align="right">Summertown Choral Society is a well-established, mixed-voice choir based in North Oxford with around 130 members drawn from the city and surrounding areas. The choir traditionally holds two concerts each season, in January/February and May/June, and aims for a high musical standard. We rehearse in the church of <a href="http://www.stmichaels-summertown.org.uk/index.htm">St Michael and All Angels</a> on Lonsdale Rd in Summertown each Thursday evening 8 &ndash; 9.30pm from September to June, with short breaks for Christmas and Easter.</p>
                            <p align="justify">The choir has been directed by <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/main/director.htm">Duncan Saunderson</a> since 1996, with <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/main/accompanist.htm">Julian Littlewood</a> as accompanist from 1997.</p>
                            <p align="justify">We are a large and inclusive choir in which members of all standards enjoy singing. Musicianship is fostered with a planned rehearsal schedule, workshops and opportunities to sing in smaller groups. The social side of music-making is also something we enjoy, with regular events, parties, and an annual choir holiday. Everyone should be able to enjoy choral singing and we try to make this happen. </p>
                            <p align="justify">Since its foundation in 1961, SCS has performed a diverse range of choral music, from major works such as <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/concerts/2009%20Jan.htm">Brahms's <em>German Requiem</em></a> and <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/concerts/2009%20May.htm">Mozart's <em>Great Mass in C minor</em></a> to less familiar miniatures such as <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/concerts/2008%20May.htm">Britten's <em>Five Flower Songs</em></a> and Randall Thompson&rsquo;s <em><a href="../concerts/2012 May.htm">Frostiana</a></em>. In February 2012, the choir performed J.S. Bach's&nbsp; <em><a href="../concerts/2012 Feb.htm">Mass in B Minor </a></em>with period instruments: &ldquo;<em>&hellip; this seemed a particularly spirited and heartfelt performance. Conductor Duncan Saunderson was bristling with purpose as he took to the stand, and the 130-strong choir was in fine fettle, delivering the choruses with
                                commitment and enthusiasm.</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;(<em>Oxford Times</em> 8th February 2012) </p>
                            <p align="justify">Works recently commissioned for the choir include <a href="http://www.graystonives.com/">Bill Ives&rsquo;s</a> <em>Songs of Ariel</em>, based on texts from Shakespeare, and, for the choir&rsquo;s golden jubilee concert in 2011, Philip Moore&rsquo;s <em><a href="../concerts/2011 Jul.htm">Three Oxford Songs</a>.</em><br>
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">Excerpts from these and many other performances may be found on our <a href="http://www.summertownchoral.org.uk/main/concerts.htm">concert history pages</a>, along with photos and other memorabilia. </p>
