                            <p>No officer shall hold a second office in the Society concurrently, even in an acting capacity.</p>

                            <p>Every matter shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members of the Committee present and voting on the question, but in the case of equality of votes, the chair of the meeting shall have a second or &lsquo;casting&rsquo; vote.</p>
