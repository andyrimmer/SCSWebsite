    <h1>Montecchio, Umbria ~ August 2009 </h1>

          <p>25th August  2009 saw the Summertown Singers gather once again in Montecchio, for a third  successful and extremely enjoyable singing holiday in this picturesque village  in the Umbrian hills. Although we were greeted with a rather violent  thunderstorm on our first evening, the weather for the rest of the week was  even hotter than on previous years, which made our post-rehearsal refreshments  at the local bar particularly welcome!</p>
		  <a href="2009 Italy/Men Rehearsing.jpg"><img src="2009 Italy/Men Rehearsing.jpg" alt="Men Rehearsing" width="160" height="120" hspace="10" border="0" align="left"></a>
          <p>As usual, we  rehearsed twice a day, in the morning and in the early evening, preparing for  the two concerts we would present at the end of the week. Singing in a small <em>a  cappella</em> group is certainly a challenge, but it is also a very rewarding  activity that provides the opportunity to explore and perform works rather  different from those typically performed by larger choirs.</p>
          <p>The central  work in our sacred repertoire this year was Tom&aacute;s Luis de Victoria&rsquo;s <em>Missa O  Quam Gloriosum</em>. In addition to further works by Victoria, this part of the programme also incorporated  pieces by Thomas Tallis, and finished with the beautiful Negro spiritual &lsquo;Steal  away&rsquo;. Our secular repertoire included a variety of English and Italian  madrigals and part-songs, but the men&rsquo;s rendition of the American folk song  &lsquo;L&rsquo;il Liza Jane&rsquo; was perhaps the highlight!</p>
          <a href="2009 Italy/Orvieto.jpg"><img src="2009 Italy/Orvieto.jpg" alt="Orvieto - Duomo" width="144" height="192" hspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a>
          <p>Our first  concert took place on Friday evening in the beautiful twelfth century church of Santa Maria Assunta in Lugnano in  Teverina, where we thrilled our hosts not only with our music, but also with  our gift of some rather distinctive Oxford Blue cheese! &nbsp;We were delighted  that our concert in Montecchio on Saturday evening, in the fifteenth century church of Santa Maria, formed part of the celebrations  for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the village priest, Don Giuliano Pagliaricci. </p>
          <p>While music was  naturally the focal point of the week, Montecchio and the surrounding area  offered many other pleasures, and we had ample free time in which to make the  most of them: sampling local specialities such as black truffles and roast wild  boar; visiting the nearby town of Orvieto and admiring its impressive  cathedral; and, of course, simply relaxing in the sun with a good book, taking  an occasional dip in the pool. In typical SCS style, we brought the week to a  close with a party, at which we shared plenty of food, wine, laughter, and  song!</p>
