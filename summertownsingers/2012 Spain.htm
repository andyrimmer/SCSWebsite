<h2 align="center"><strong>Choir visit to Santo Domingo de la Calzada</strong></h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="justify"><br>
              Having only joined SCS  in October 2011, this was my first opportunity to take part in the annual  summer visit to sing in foreign parts. This year some 35 of us (including three  friends of Duncan who strengthened the tenor and bass lines) met up in Santo  Domingo de la Calzada, a delightful small medi&aelig;val town in the Rioja Alta  region, on the final (common) part of the northern and eastern pilgrim routes  to Santiago de Compostela. As usual, the trip was organised by Diane Benfield,  whose calm efficiency was responsible for the success of the venture, though  the degree of understanding we enjoyed with the locals was greatly enhanced by  our Spanish-speaking alto, Sue Cavanna. </p>
            <p align="justify">My dilatoriness in  getting down to booking the trip was solved by an email from Diane in late  March saying that Clive Booth had hired a car from Bilbao airport and was  offering transport to and from Santo Domingo. I then grasped the nettle and  booked my flights and accommodation. Without that kind offer I would have  continued dithering for weeks and paid much more for both.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">We arrived on the  evening of Monday 13th August, and rehearsals, which took place in a  beautiful old chapel adjacent to the cathedral, started the next morning. Most  of these 3-hour sessions were punctuated by a practice of the challenging  men-only Schubert piece, during which we women bonded over coffee. Tourists  (almost entirely Spanish) were quite uninhibited about entering the chapel  during our rehearsals, and sometimes stayed long enough to applaud, which was  encouraging! Afternoons were free, with only one organised trip, to the bodega (winery)  of Lopez de Heredia near Haro, where last year's concert took place. After a  fascinating tour of the cellars, in which wine has been made and stored by the  same methods and the same family since 1877, there was of course a tasting, at  which we sang one of our pieces to the wonderful young woman who had shown us  round.
            </p>
        
             
           
            <p align="justify">On the first evening,  several of us went to see the local pageant, in which large numbers of local  people of all ages (I reckon the youngest was only 3) presented the story of  Santo Domingo with words, music and live animals (a cock and hen, and horses  including one performing dressage movements). It was entirely in Spanish but quite  comprehensible if one had read a summary about the town and its saint on the  internet in advance of the trip. It was fun to discover why a live cock and hen  are still kept in a cage in the cathedral. </p>
            <p align="justify">On Saturday evening we  sang the Byrd 4-part mass for the cathedral service. The priest told us  afterwards that the congregation had numbered around 700, 450-500 of whom  stayed on for the secular concert. For the mass, we were placed in a small  side-aisle in front of a magnificently ornate late gothic retablo. The spare  folding chairs stored alongside our benches were much in demand as people continued  to arrive long after the pews were full, even squeezing past Duncan to get them  while he was conducting us. We relatively inhibited British found this behaviour  culturally fascinating! After the service we moved to a rather cramped space in  front of the altar for the concert. It went down so well that we were treated  to a noisy standing ovation and sang one of the songs again as an encore. As we  left to go upstairs for a magnificent spread, many people came over to us  expressing their warm thanks - it was very moving. Apparently there is no  tradition of this kind of choral singing in Spain, so it was much appreciated.  After the generous cathedral-sponsored buffet we went to a nearby outdoor caf&eacute;  for drinks, as guests of the current owner of the bodega, who is the  great-grand-daughter of the founder.              </p>
            <p align="justify">I am enormously grateful  to Duncan for his expert musical direction of the lovely music, both sacred and  secular, that he chose for the trip. The discipline of singing every day was  great, and the concert itself quite inspiring - was I really contributing to  this lovely sound? I knew very few of the group before we started rehearsing,  and getting to know a small core of SCS members has been one of the lasting  benefits of joining this band of enthusiasts. At last, I'll be one of those  people who warmly greet fellow singers at SCS rehearsals this coming term!
